# Self-organized Art Initiatives in Switzerland

This data set was created as part of the ["Off Off Of?"](https://www.hslu.ch/en/lucerne-university-of-applied-sciences-and-arts/research/projects/detail/?pid=1045) research project at the Lucerne School of Design, Film and Art. It contains information about more than 700 self-organized art initiatives in Switzerland and is the basis for the project website [selbstorganisation-in-der-kunst.ch](https://selbstorganisation-in-der-kunst.ch).

The data set consist of 3 tables, where `data/projects.csv` is the main table and `data/people.csv` and `data/places.csv` refer to it with additional information. `datapackage.json` explains the structure and the data types according to [Frictionless Data](https://frictionlessdata.io) conventions.

The data set requires further cleaning, which is planned for [GLAMhack24](https://opendata.ch/de/events/glamhack24/).
